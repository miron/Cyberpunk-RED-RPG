Welcome to the NeonCore Framework, the ultimate modular toolkit for building immersive role-playing experiences. Developed by the team at street.yoga in their free time, we've taken our dedication to creating a framework that is not only easy to use, but also easy to expand upon for future projects.

Whether you're building a game set in the gritty world of Night City, or creating an entirely new world of your own, the NeonCore Framework has everything you need to bring your vision to life. From our story manager with modular story elements, to our map class and skill check commander, every aspect of the framework has been designed with ease of use and expansion in mind.

Our character and lifepath class allows for deep customization of player characters, while our NPC behavior class ensures that the non-player characters in your world feel truly alive. The Characters Manager and Action Manager work seamlessly together to provide a smooth and immersive gameplay experience.

The command registrar class allows for easy registration and management of in-game commands, making it simple to add new features and functionality as your game grows.

Built in Python, the **NeonCore Framework** is a terminal-based game that fits into 80x24, has graphic fidelity with animated ASCII art, and even has the potential to be a mod for Cyberpunk 2077, playable on a VT52.

At **street.yoga**, we're dedicated to creating tools that empower game developers to bring their visions to life. The NeonCore Framework is the ultimate tool for building immersive role-playing experiences, no matter the genre.
