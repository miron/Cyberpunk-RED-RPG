trouble', 'Most social norms had dissolved under an allengulfing wave of competing special interest groups mediafueled fads and an overall me first worldview', 'By 1994 the number of homeless on the streets had skyrocketed to 21 million', 'The technical revolution had further torn the economy apart creating two radically divergent classesa wealthy technically oriented materially acquisitive group of Corporate profession als and a downclass of homeless unskilled bluecol lar workers', 'The middle class was nearly eradicated', 'It was this dismal beginning that led to the American landscape of the 2000s', 'Here are just a few of the major trends leading to the collapse of the American Nation', ' Urban Collapse  In large cities business areas were clean neat welllit showcases free of crime and poverty controlled by powerful Corporations', 'Ringing the central areas were the Combat Zonesdecrepit squalid suburbs and burnedout ghettos teeming with boostergangs and other violent sociopaths', 'The outer suburbs were also Corporatecontrolled zones safe wellguarded tracts where executives raised their families in relative security', ' Corrupt and Ineffective Government  Under the corrupt rule of the Gang of Four a cabal of four government agencies the NSA the CIA the DEA and the FBI all led by the brilliant and psychopathic Vice President American government descended into the realm of mobster rule', 'Ruthlessly pursuing its agenda of illicit profit above all the Gang hollowed out Social Security and Medicare eliminated Welfare unless tied to one of their Corporate clients and plundered the resources of the United States like a giant personal piggybank', 'The only untouched area of the government was the military which the Gang lavished money upon to maintain service loyalty and to finance the Gangs expansive policy of warbased imperialism', 'By the time the Gang was ousted the US Senate was no longer functional having been suborned or intimidated by the Gang over years the Supreme Court was no longer the law of the land for the increasing number of selfdeclared Free States and most of the federal bureaucracy was in shambles leaving the country unable to cope with the waves of crises devastating the population', ' The Rise of the Free States  Individual states fed up with the ineffectual and dicta torial actions of the bureaucrats in Washington DC and the recently exposed machinations of the Gang of Four began to break away from the main body of the country first California north and later south then Texas Oregon Washington and the Dakotas', 'These new Free States set their own laws although most were remarkably similar trade arrangements and most importantly no longer sent their collected taxes back to Washington DC', 'This only hurried the collapse of the unified nation', ' The New Rustbowl  Unprepared to deal with the effects of worldwide global warming vast areas of the northern hemi sphere began to suffer unending years of backtoback drought', 'Throughout the Midwestern states many small towns were abandoned as local farms businesses and banks collapsed in the wake of this drought famine and economic chaos', 'What farms that survived were eventually bought up by huge Agricorporations and were maintained with Corporatecontrolled wells hired workers machine labor and wellequipped guards', 'Midwest urban zones also

' Endless War  With the option to deploy cybernetically boosted supersoldiers and an unlimited military budget the Gang of Four was able to prosecute a series of foreign wars to start its new era of imperialism', 'But even with these advantages the United States found itself dragged into a series of military quagmires with echoes of the Soviets in Afghanistan and the Old US in Vietnam', 'This became even worse as the targeted nations began to use terrorist strikes such as a pocket nuke in New York to hit back at the Gang', 'By the time the Cyber Soldier Ten Thousand fought its way back from the SouthAm hellhole the citizens of the United States were exceptionally tired of the endless battles filling their nightly news', ' And Finally Technoshock  When technological change outstrips
